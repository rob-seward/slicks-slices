Thanks to Wes!...This was awesome go around Gatsby, checking out different ways of sourcing and rendering out data.
I loved the front end stuff using grid and getting familiar with clamp and css custom properties for responsivenessssss.
This was my first go with react hooks and it really helped cement some of the jamstack concepts.
Serverless functions are really cool... Sanity / Netlify / git with continuous deploy looks like a good way to manage all this.
